  * every file in master branch or every change in master branch is shown in all branches


## Git Commands
  * git branch  - > Shows the no of branches available in repo
  * git checkout -b branch-name -> used to make new branch and we switch into it

  * git push origin branch-name - > push the committed data into given branch name
  * git checkout branch-name -> change the branch being used
  * git branch -a - > shows new branches added on repo but didn't recieved on cloning
